CSS Combinators:

A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

There are four different combinators in CSS:

descendant selector (space)
child selector (>)
adjacent sibling selector (+)
general sibling selector (~)


1.Descendant Selector: The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

ex: 
div p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

2.Child Selector (>): The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

Ex: 
div > p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

3.Adjacent Sibling Selector (+):
